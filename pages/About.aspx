    <h1>Our story</h1>
    <p>
       JW & Co started as a humble enterprise with just a handful of employees, but its founder, James Ward, had a vision. He wanted to build a law firm that would prioritise the needs of its clients above everything else.

James Ward was a lawyer with a passion for justice. He had worked for several large firms in London but grew disillusioned with the way they treated their clients as mere numbers. He believed that every client deserved personalised attention and care. So, he decided to start his own law firm in his hometown.
